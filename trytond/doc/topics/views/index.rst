Views
=====

The views are used to display records of an :class:`ModelView
<trytond.model.ModelView>` to the user.

In Tryton, :class:`ModelView <trytond.model.ModelView>` can have several views.
An ``action`` opens a window and defines which view to show.

The views are built from XML that is stored in the :file:`view` directory of
the module or in the databases thanks to the `View <model-ir.ui.view>`.

So generally, they are defined in XML files with this kind of XML where name is
the name of the XML file in the :file:`view` directory:

.. highlight:: xml

::

  <record model="ir.ui.view" id="view_id">
      <field name="model">model name</field>
      <field name="type">type name</field>
      <!--field name="inherit" ref="inherit_view_id"/-->
      <!--field name="field_childs">field name</field-->
      <field name="name">view_name</field>
  </record>


There are different types of views:

.. contents::
   :local:
   :backlinks: entry
   :depth: 2

Some attributes are shared by many form elements:

.. _common-attributes-id:

``id``
   A unique identifier for the tag if there is no name attribute.

.. _common-attributes-yexpand:

``yexpand``
   A boolean to specify if the label should expand to take up any extra
   vertical space.

   to it in the table cell.

Form
====

A form view is used to display one record.

Elements of the view are put on the screen following the rules:

    * Elements are placed on the screen from left to right, from top to bottom,
      according to the order of the XML.

    * The screen composed of a table with a fixed number of columns and enough
      rows to handle all elements.

    * Elements take one or more columns when they are put in the table. If
      there are not enough free columns on the current row, the elements are put
      at the beginning of the next row.

.. _example_form_view:

Example:

.. highlight:: xml

::

  <form col="6">
      <label name="name"/>
      <field name="name" xexpand="1"/>
      <label name="code"/>
      <field name="code"/>
      <label name="active"/>
      <field name="active" xexpand="0" width="100"/>
      <notebook colspan="6">
          <page string="General">
              <field name="addresses" mode="form,tree" colspan="4"
                  view_ids="party.address_view_form,party.address_view_tree_sequence"/>
              <label name="type"/>
              <field name="type" widget="selection"/>
              <label name="lang"/>
              <field name="lang" widget="selection"/>

              <separator string="Categories" colspan="4"/>
              <field name="categories" colspan="4"/>
          </page>
          <page string="Accounting">
              <label name="vat_country"/>
              <field name="vat_country"/>
              <label name="vat_number"/>
              <field name="vat_number"/>
          </page>
      </notebook>
  </form>

        <field name="invoice_date"/>
    </x>
    <y>
        <field name="total_amount"/>
    </y>
  </graph>


The RNG that describes the XML for a graph view is stored in

``string``
   The string to use as label for the field.

``key``
   Used to distinguish fields with the same name but with different domain.

.. _`Nearest-neighbor interpolation`:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nearest-neighbor_interpolation
.. _`linear interpolation`: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_interpolation


Board
=====

Board view is used to display multiple views at once.

Elements are put on the screen following the same rules as for ``Form`` view.

The views can be updated by the selection of records on an other view inside
the same board by using in the domain the ``active_id`` or ``active_ids`` from
the ``_actions`` dictionary with the action id of the other view as key.
For example:

.. highlight:: xml

::

   <field
      name="domain"
      pyson="1"
      eval="[('field', '=', Eval('_actions', {}).get('module.action_id', {}).get('active_id'))]"/>

The RNG that describes the XML for a board view is stored in
``trytond/ir/ui/board.rng``.
There is also a RNC in ``trytond/ir/ui/graph.rnc``.
