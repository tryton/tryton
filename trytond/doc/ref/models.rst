Class attributes are:

.. attribute:: Model.__name__

   The a unique name to reference the model throughout the platform.

.. attribute:: Model.__string__

   A string for the label of the model.
   The default value is built from :attr:`~Model.__name__`.

.. attribute:: Model.__access__

   A set that contains the names of relation field for which the access rights
   are also checked for this model.

.. attribute:: Model.__rpc__

   A dictionary with method name as key and an instance of
   :class:`~trytond.rpc.RPC` as value.

   The definition of the :class:`~trytond.model.fields.Integer` field ``id`` of
   records.

.. attribute:: Model.__queue__

   Return a queue caller for the model.
   The called method will be pushed into the queue.

.. attribute:: Model._fields

   A dictionary with the field name as key and its
   :class:`~fields.Field` instance as value.

.. attribute:: Model._record

   The record class to store internaly the values of the instances.

.. attribute:: Model._defaults

   A dictionary with the field name as key and its default method as value.

Class methods:

.. classmethod:: Model.__setup__()

   Setup the class before adding into the :class:`~trytond.pool.Pool`.
   See :meth:`trytond.pool.PoolBase.__setup__`.

.. classmethod:: Model.__post_setup__()

.. classmethod:: Model.default_get([fields_names[[, with_rec_name], with_default]])

   Return a dictionary with the default values for each field in
   ``fields_names`` or all fields if not specified.
   Default values are defined by the returned value of each class method with
   the pattern ``default_<field name>()``.

   ``with_rec_name`` allow to add ``rec_name`` value for each
   :class:`~trytond.model.fields.Many2One`,
   :class:`~trytond.model.fields.One2One`,
   :class:`~trytond.model.fields.Reference` field.

   ``with_default`` allows to not use the value from the ``default_<field
   name>`` methods.

   The ``default_rec_name`` key in the context can be used to define the value
   of the :attr:`~Model._rec_name` field.

   The ``default_<field name>`` keys in the context can be used to define the
   value of the field.

   value.

   The keys of ``default`` may use the dotted notation for the
   :class:`~fields.One2Many` to define the default to pass to its ``copy``
   operation.

   New records are returned following the input order.

   .. note::

      The :class:`~fields.One2Many` and :class:`~fields.Many2Many` relation
      fields are not copied if their :attr:`~fields.Field.readonly` attribute

   The ``order`` is a list of tuples defining the order of the result::

      [ ('field name', 'ASC'), ('other field name', 'DESC'), ... ]

   The first element of the tuple is a field name of the model and the second
   is the sort ordering as ``ASC`` for ascending, ``DESC`` for descending or
   empty for a default order.
   This second element may contain ``NULLS FIRST`` or ``NULLS LAST`` to sort
   null values before or after non-null values.
   If neither is specified the default behavior of the backend is used.

   In case the field used is a :class:`~fields.Many2One`, it is also possible
   to use the dotted notation to sort on a specific field from the target
   record.
   Or for a :class:`~fields.Dict` field, the dotted notation is used to sort on
   the key's value.

   If ``count`` is set to ``True``, then the result is the number of records.
   The count result is limited upto the value of ``limit`` if set.

.. classmethod:: ModelStorage.search_count(domain[, offset[, limit]])

   Return a symbol and its position.

   The position indicates whether the symbol should appear before (0) or after
   (1) the value.
   If no symbol parameter is supplied then the mixin uses the value of
   attribute named ``symbol``.

DigitsMixin
===========

:attr:`fields.Numeric.digits` from a :class:`Model`.

Instance methods:

.. method:: DigitsMixin.get_digits()

   Return a tuple of two integers to use a ``digits`` attribute.

sequence_ordered
================

.. function:: sequence_ordered([field_name, [field_label, [order]]])

Return a mixin_ class which defines the order of a :class:`ModelSQL` with an
:class:`~fields.Integer` field.

``field_name`` indicates the name of the field to be created and its default
values is ``sequence``.
``field_label`` defines the label which will be used by the field and defaults
to ``Sequence``.
Order specifies the order direction and defaults to ``ASC NULLS FIRST``.

sort
====

.. function:: sort(records, order)

Return a new list of records ordered by the ``order`` list defined like in
:meth:`~ModelStorage.search`.


sequence_reorder

   records.
   Returns the list of records.

MultiValueMixin
===============

.. class:: MultiValueMixin

A mixin_ for :class:`Model` to help having :class:`~fields.MultiValue` fields
with multi-values on a :class:`ValueMixin`.
The values are stored by creating one record per pattern.
The patterns are the same as those on :class:`MatchMixin`.

Class methods:

.. classmethod:: MultiValueMixin.multivalue_model(field)

   Return the :class:`ValueMixin` on which the values are stored for the field
   name.

   The default is class name suffixed by the field name.

.. classmethod:: MultiValueMixin.setter_multivalue(records, name, value, \*\*pattern)

   :attr:`~fields.Function.getter` method for the
   :class:`trytond.model.fields.Function` fields.

Instance methods:

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.multivalue_records(field)

   Return the list of all :class:`ValueMixin` records linked to the instance.

   By default, it returns the value of the first found

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.get_multivalue(name, \*\*pattern)

   Return the value of the field ``name`` for the pattern.

.. method:: MultiValueMixin.set_multivalue(name, value[, save], \*\*pattern)

   Store the value of the field ``name`` for the pattern.

   If ``save`` is true, it will be stored in the database, otherwise the
   modified :class:`ValueMixin` records are returned unsaved.
   ``save`` is true by default.

.. warning::
    To customize the pattern, both methods must be override the same way.

ValueMixin
==========

.. class:: ValueMixin

A mixin_ to store the values of :class:`MultiValueMixin`.

DeactivableMixin

A mixin_ to add soft deletion to the model.
It renders all the fields as read-only when the record is inactive.

Class attributes are:

.. attribute:: DeactivableMixin.active

   The definition of the :class:`trytond.model.fields.Boolean` field to store
   soft deletion state.

   False values is considered as soft deletion.

tree

.. function:: avatar_mixin([size[, default]])

Return a mixin_ :class:`AvatarMixin`.

``size`` defines the size of the avatar image and its default value is ``64``.
``default`` indicates the name of the field to use for generating a default
avatar, if it's not set then no default avatar is generated.
