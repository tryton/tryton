Client Usage
############
This document is the reference about the concepts of the graphical user
interface (also known as *Tryton client* ) of the Tryton application framework.


Name
****
tryton - Graphical user client of the Tryton application framework


Synopsis
********

.. code-block:: console

   $ tryton [options] [url]

On startup the login dialog is displayed.

Options
*******

--version                            Show program version number and exit

-h, --help                           Show help message and exit

-c FILE, --config=FILE               Specify alternate `configuration file`_

-d, --dev                            Enable development mode, which deactivates
                                     client side caching

-v, --verbose                        Enable basic debugging

-l LOG_LEVEL, --log-level=LOG_LEVEL  Specify the log level: DEBUG, INFO,
                                     WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL

-o LOG_OUTPUT, --log-ouput=LOG_OUTPUT Specify the file used to output logging
                                      information

-u LOGIN, --user=LOGIN               Specify the login user

-s SERVER, --server=SERVER           Specify the server hostname:port

URL
***

When an url is passed, the client will try to find already running client that
could handle it and send to this one to open the url. If it doesn't find one
then it will start the GUI and open the url itself.

The url schemes are:

   ``tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/model/<model name>[/<id>][;parameters]``

   ``tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/wizard/<wizard name>[;parameters]``

   ``tryton://<hostname>[:<port>]/<database>/report/<report name>[;parameters]``

``parameters``
   the corresponding fields of actions encoded in `JSON`_

.. _JSON: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Json
.. Note:: ``model`` is for ``window``
.. Note:: ``report`` must have at least a data parameter with ``ids``, ``id``
   and ``model name``


Overview
********

On startup the login dialog is displayed. It allows to select a existing
profile (or to manage them) or to enter the host and database information.

The following schematic illustration of the Tryton client shows the names of
all important visual parts.

Tabbed Main Frame
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This part of the client contains all the related contents and
functions provided by the :term:`Tryton server` :term:`modules`.
All aspects inside the *main frame* depend at least on the individual set
of activated modules.

The main frame provides a `tabbed document interface`__ to arrange different
views side by side. New :term:`tabs` are opened by special :term:`actions`,
like choosing a menu item or clicking some action buttons. All tabs include
titles which show the name of the provided view.

:term:`Tabs` can be arranged by Drag and Drop.

__ TDI_

.. _TDI: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tabbed_document_interface

.. Note:: Inside :term:`views` there can be tabs, too.


Menu
++++
The *menu* does not contain fixed menu items.
All of them are dynamically provided by the actual set of the activated
:term:`modules` depending on the access rules of the current user. If a menu
item is clicked, the appropriate action will open in a new tab.

A search field allows to quickly filter the menu items by name and to search in
models for which the global search is enabled.


Application Menu
****************
The following section describes the action of the application menu.
A rule of thumb: All items of the menu bar that are suffixed by three dots
(...) will open an intermediate :term:`dialog` for setting up the provided
menu action. Most dialog provide a *Cancel* button, used to stop the
complete dialog process.

.. _Menu-Preferences:

Widgets
*******

There are a several widgets used on Tryton in client side. The follow sections
will explains some of them.


Date/DateTime/Time Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

These widgets have several key shortcuts to quickly modify the value. Each key
increases if lower case or decreases if upper case:

   - ``y``: by one year
   - ``m``: by one month
   - ``w``: by one week
   - ``d``: by one day
   - ``h``: by one hour
   - ``i``: by one minute
   - ``s``: by one second

The ``=`` key sets the widget value to the current date and time.

TimeDelta Widgets
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This widget represent a duration using different symbol of time separated by
space:

   - ``Y``: for years (default: 365 days)
   - ``M``: for months (default: 30 days)
   - ``w``: for weeks (default: 7 days)
   - ``d``: for days (default: 24 hours)
   - ``h``: for hours (default: 60 minutes)
   - ``m``: for minutes (default: 60 seconds)
   - ``s``: for seconds (default: 1 seconds)

The hours, minutes and seconds are also represented as ``H:M:s``.

For example: ``2w 3d 4:30`` which represents: two weeks, three days and four
and an half hours.

The value of each symbol may be changed by the context of the widget. For
example, a day could be configured as 8 hours.

Search Widget
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The search widget adds the ability to easily search for records on the current
tab.
This widget is visible only on :term:`tree view`.

The Syntax
++++++++++

A query is composed of search clauses.
A clause is composed of a field name (with ``:`` at the end), an operator and a
value.
The field name is optional and defaults to the record name.
The operator is also optional and defaults to ``ilike`` or ``=`` depending on
the type of the field.
The default operator is ``=`` except for fields of type ``char``, ``text`` and
``many2one`` which is ``ilike``.

Field Names
+++++++++++

All field names shown in the :term:`tree view` can be searched. Field names
must be followed by a ``:``.

   For example: ``Name:``

If the field name contains spaces, it is possible to
escape it using double quotes.

   For example: ``"Receivable Today":``

Operators
+++++++++

The following operators can be used:

   * ``=``: equal to
   * ``<``: less then
   * ``<=``: less then or equal to
   * ``>``: greater then
   * ``>=``: greater then or equal to
   * ``!=``: not equal
   * ``!``: not equal or not like (depending of the type of field)

   For example: ``Name: != Dwight``

Values
++++++

The format of the value depends on the type of the field.
A list of values can be set using ``;`` as separator.

   For example: ``Name: Michael; Pam``

   It will find all records with ``Name`` equal to ``Michael`` or ``Pam``.

A range of number values can be set using ``..``.

   For example: ``Amount: 100..500``

   It will find all records with ``Amount`` between ``100`` and ``500``
   included.

There are two wildcards:

   * ``%``: matches any string of zero or more characters.
   * ``_``: matches any single character.

It is possible to escape special characters in values by using double quotes or
prepending ``\\``.

   For example: ``Name: "Michael:Scott"``

   Here it will search with the value ``Michael:Scott``.

   Or: ``Name: Michael\\_Scott``

   Here it will search with the value ``Michael\_Scott``.

Clause composition
++++++++++++++++++

The clauses can be composed using the two boolean operators ``&`` (for `logical
conjunction`_) and ``|`` (for `logical disjunction`_).
By default, there is an implicit ``&`` between each clause if no operator is
specified.

   For example: ``Name: Michael Amount: 100``

   is the same as ``Name: Michael & Amount: 100``

The ``&`` operator has a highest precedence than ``|`` but you can change it by
using parenthesis.

   For example: ``(Name: Michael | Name: Pam) & Amount: 100``

   is different than ``Name: Michael | Name: Pam & Amount: 100``

   which is evaluated as ``Name: Michael | (Name: Pam & Amount: 100)``

RichText Editor
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This feature create a rich text editor with various features that allow for
text formatting. The features are:

   * Bold: On/off style of bold text
   * Italic: On/off style of italic text
   * Underline: On/off style of underline text
   * Choose font family: Choice from a combo box the desired font family
   * Choose font size: Choice from a combo box the desired size font
   * Text justify: Choice between four options for alignment of the line (left,
     right, center, fill)
   * Background color: Choose the background color of text from a color palette
   * Foreground color: Choose the foreground color of text from a color palette

Besides these features, it can change and edit text markup. The text markup
feature has a similar HTML tags and is used to describe the format specified by
the user and is a way of storing this format for future opening of a correct
formatted text. The tags are explain follows:

   * Bold: Tag ``b`` is used, i.e. <b>text</b>
   * Italic: Tag ``i`` is used, i.e. <i>text</i>
   * Underline: Tag ``u`` is used, i.e. <u>text</u>
   * Font family: It is a attribute ``font-family`` for ``span`` tag, i.e.
     <span font-family="Arial">text</span>
   * Font size: It is a attribute ``size`` for ``span`` tag, i.e. <span
     size="12"> text</span>
   * Text Justify: For justification text is used paragraph tag ``p``.
     The paragraph tag is used to create new lines and the alignment is applied
     across the board.
     Example: <p align='center'>some text</p>
   * Background color: It is a attribute ``background`` for ``span`` tag, i.e.
     <span background='#7f7f7f'>text</span>
   * Foreground color: It is a attribute ``foreground`` for ``span`` tag, i.e.
     <span foreground='#00f'>text</span>

CSS
***

The client can be styled using the file :file:`theme.css`.

Here are the list of custom selectors:

   * ``.readonly``: read only widget or label

   * ``.required``: widget or label of required field

   * ``.invalid``: widget for which the field value is not valid

   * ``headerbar.profile-<name>``: the name of the connection profile is set on
     the main window
