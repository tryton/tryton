Making products rentable
========================

Before you can add a `Product <product:concept-product>` to a `Rental
<model-sale.rental>` it must be marked as rentable.
Only the types assets or service can be marked.
When you do this you will also be able to set some additional properties such
as the `Rental Unit <product:model-product.uom>` and the prices the product is
normally rented at.
You can also specify if the rental duration is per day or not.
