Setting your current company and employee
=========================================

If you want to change your current `Company <model-company.company>` or
`Employee <model-company.employee>`, you should do this by opening your
preferences and selecting the desired company and employee from the list the
administrator has predefined for your `User <trytond:model-res.user>`.

   If you try and change your current company or employee from inside the
   [:menuselection:`Administration --> Users --> Users`] menu entry then it
   will only change when you next login, or update your preferences.
