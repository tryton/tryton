Sale Module
###########

The *Sale Module* helps organise and manage sales made by the company.
It adds the concept of a sale to Tryton and allows it to be tracked through
its states from draft to done.
It also oversees the creation of customer shipments and invoices for the sales,
and allows reports to be generated that contain aggregated sales figures.
