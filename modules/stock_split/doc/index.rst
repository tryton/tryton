Stock Split Module
##################

The Stock Split module adds on the stock move a wizard that allows to split them.
The move is split into moves of *Quantity*. If *Counts* is set, it will be
split only this number of times. On occasion there can be a move with the
remaining quantity.

It also adds on *Customer*, *Supplier Return* and *Internal* shipments a wizard
that allows to split them. The selected moves of the shipment are shifted to a
new copy of the shipment.
