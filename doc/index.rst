Project Revenue Module
######################

The project revenue module computes revenue and cost per task and project.
The revenue uses the list price of the product. If the product's unit of
measure is time based, the revenue is computed as the product of the price and
the hours of effort otherwise the price is considered as fixed.
The cost is computed by summing the cost of all the linked time sheets and the
linked purchase lines.
